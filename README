NAME
    App::shcompgen - Backend for shcompgen script

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.06 of App::shcompgen (from Perl
    distribution App-shcompgen), released on 2014-12-14.

FUNCTIONS
  generate(%args) -> [status, msg, result, meta]
    Generate shell completion scripts for detectable programs.

    Arguments ('*' denotes required arguments):

    *   bash_global_dir => *array* (default:
        ["/usr/share/bash-completion/completions",
        "/etc/bash_completion.d"])

        Directory to put completions scripts.

    *   bash_per_user_dir => *array*

        Directory to put completions scripts.

    *   global => *bool*

        Use global completions directory.

        Shell has global (system-wide) completions directory as well as
        per-user. For example, in fish the global directory is by default
        "/etc/fish/completions" and the per-user directory is
        "~/.config/fish/completions".

        By default, if running as root, the global is chosen. And if running
        as normal user, per-user directory is chosen. Using "--global" or
        "--per-user" overrides that and manually select which.

    *   prog => *array*

        Program(s) to generate completion for.

        Can contain path (e.g. "../foo") or a plain word ("foo") in which
        case will be searched from PATH.

    *   replace => *bool*

        Replace existing script.

        The default behavior is to skip if an existing completion script
        exists.

    *   shell => *str*

        Override autodetection and select shell manually.

        The default is to look at your SHELL environment variable value. If
        it is undefined, the default is "bash".

    Return value:

    Returns an enveloped result (an array).

    First element (status) is an integer containing HTTP status code (200
    means OK, 4xx caller error, 5xx function error). Second element (msg) is
    a string containing error message, or 'OK' if status is 200. Third
    element (result) is optional, the actual result. Fourth element (meta)
    is called result metadata and is optional, a hash that contains extra
    information.

     (any)

  init(%args) -> [status, msg, result, meta]
    Initialize shcompgen.

    This subcommand creates the completion directories and initialization
    shell script, as well as run "generate".

    Arguments ('*' denotes required arguments):

    *   bash_global_dir => *array* (default:
        ["/usr/share/bash-completion/completions",
        "/etc/bash_completion.d"])

        Directory to put completions scripts.

    *   bash_per_user_dir => *array*

        Directory to put completions scripts.

    *   global => *bool*

        Use global completions directory.

        By default, if running as root, the global is chosen. And if running
